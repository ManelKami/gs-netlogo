gs-netlogo is a `NetLogo`_ extension connecting NetLogo to `GraphStream`_.
NetLogo agents can send graph events using the `NetStream`_ protocol.
By receiving and processing these events, one can maintain and study a dynamic
graph view of a NetLogo simulation. The nodes of this graph correspond to the
turtles and its edges are the links between them.
